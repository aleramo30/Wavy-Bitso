# Wavy-Bitso
Hackathon MXNB Bitso 

We developed a searcher to identify if a wallet is sanctionated, also using AI agents we can create reports about the behaivor or the wallets. 
We have four categories of on-chain bad actors:
- USDC Sanctioned
- USDT Sanctioned
- OFAC Sanctioned
- Tornado Cash interaction
